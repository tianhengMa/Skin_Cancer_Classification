# Skin_Cancer_Classification

In this project, our team is classifying the type of skin cancer based on the image of the lesion. Traditionally, the types of skin cancer are manually classified by medical doctors. However, the diagnosis would normally take a long time and doctors would spend less time with the patient. Therefore, our team is trying to find a way to automatically classify skin cancer using machine learning to reduce diagnosis time. This provides helpful information to the doctors for more accurate and precise diagnosis. 

We used the Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM 10,000 dataset which contains 10,000 dermatoscopic  images of 7 different skin lesions. This dataset is provided on the Harvard Dataverse as a dataset which can be used as a training set for academic machine learning purposes.
